# Base Jekyll configuration

# Note: Grunt handles some Jekyll configuration. If you set something here and
# it doesn't work, check if it is set in the Gruntfile. There is also a
# _config.build.yml to set custom overrides for `grunt build`.



# Exclude directories and/or files from the conversion.
# Grunt moves image files and asset directories.

# Force inclusion of directories and/or files in the conversion.
# .htaccess is a good example since dotfiles are excluded by default.
