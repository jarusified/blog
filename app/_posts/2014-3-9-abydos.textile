The Abydos Dynasty was a short-lived local dynasty that ruled over part of Upper Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period in Ancient Egypt and was contemporary with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties, approximately from 1650 to 1600 BC.[1] The existence of an Abydos Dynasty was first proposed by Detlef Franke[2] and later elaborated on by Egyptologist Kim Ryholt in 1997. The existence of the dynasty was confirmed in January 2014, when the tomb of the previously unknown pharaoh Seneb Kay was discovered in Abydos.[1] The dynasty tentatively includes four rulers: Wepwawetemsaf, Pantjeny, Snaaib,[3] and Seneb Kay.

The royal necropolis of the Abydos Dynasty was found in the southern part of Abydos, in an area called Anubis Mountain in ancient times. The rulers of the Abydos Dynasty placed their burial ground adjacent to the tombs of the Middle Kingdom rulers.[1
