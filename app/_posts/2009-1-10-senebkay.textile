Woseribre Senebkay was an Egyptian pharaoh during the Second Intermediate Period. The discovery of his tomb in January of 2014 supports the existence of an independent Abydos Dynasty, contemporary with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties.[1] He might also appear in the Turin Canon, where there appear two kings with the throne name "Weser... re" (the names are only partly preserved). The existence of the so-called Abydos Dynasty was first proposed by Detlef Franke[2] and later further developed by Egyptologist Kim Ryholt in 1997.
